# Olar-Weather-Station
This repository shares the information on the metadata of the weather station, and sampling rate, and provides readers with request access to weather station data.<br> 
The variables measured by the weather station and their respective units.<br> 
BattV=Volts (Battery voltage level); Sampled every 5 seconds.<br>
PTemp_C=Deg C; Sampled every 5 seconds.<br>
SlrMJ=MJ/m^2 (Total solar radiation measured using Pyranometer) Calculated based on the SlrW and scan rate.<br> 
DewPtC=Deg C (Dew point temperature) Scanned every minute and averaged over 60 minutes.<br>
BP_mbar=mbar (Barometric pressure) Measured every 5 seconds and averaged for every 60 minutes.<br>
WS_ms=meters/second (Wind speed) Measured every 5 seconds and averaged for every 60 minutes.<br>
WindDir=degrees (Wind direction).<br>
AirTC=Deg C (Air temperature) Measured every 5 seconds and averaged every 60 minutes.<br>
RH=% (Relative Humidity) Measured every 5 seconds and averaged every 60 minutes.<br>
Rain_mm=mm (Rain) Measured every 5 seconds and totaled for every 60 minutes.<br>
VWC=m^3/m^3 (Volumetric water content) Scanned every minute and averaged over 60 minutes.<br>
EC=dS/m (Electric conductivity) Scanned every minute and averaged over 60 minutes.<br>
T=Deg C (Temperature from the soil moisture sensor) Scanned every minute and averaged over 60 minutes.<br>
P=unitless (Permittivity) Scanned every minute and averaged over 60 minutes.<br>
PA=nSec (Signal travel time) Scanned every minute and averaged over 60 minutes.<br>
VR=unitless Scanned every minute and averaged over 60 minutes.<br>
SlrW=W/m^2 (Solar radiation) Scanned every minute and averaged over 60 minutes.<br>
Raw_mV=mV Scanned every minute and averaged over 60 minutes.<br>
CS320_Temp=Deg C (Temperature measured by the Pyranometer) Scanned every minute and averaged over 60 minutes.<br>
CS320_Angle=degrees (Solar radiation angle) Scanned every minute and averaged over 60 minutes.<br>

The current version of the program running in Datalogger is shared for you to look at.<br>
If you need access to weather station data, please reach out to hdakshin@scsu. If you need any changes to be made in the datalogger program to align with your research objectives please send that information along to the same email id.<br>
If you belong to South Carolina State University and 1890, please install the LoggerLink app on your smartphone. Reach out to the above email ID after installing, all the details regarding the weather station will be shared to monitor the data using the app on your mobile device.<br>
The dashboard for Olar Weather station is available at this link: https://app.konectgds.com/kiosk/a44bb94a-6d20-4d53-bd09-520fc1a1c628 <br>
The dashboard gets updated every 60 minutes and is open for the public to view. <br>
The information on the sensors installed and their respective manuals are also available for your reference. <br>
The weather station product manual folder description contains the list of all the sensors used for reference.<br>
