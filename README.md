# Olar-Weather-Station
This repository shares the information on the metadata of the weather station, and sampling rate, and provides readers with request access to weather station data
The variables measured by the weather station and their respective units. 
BattV=Volts (Battery voltage level); Sampled every 5 seconds.
PTemp_C=Deg C; Sampled every 5 seconds.
SlrMJ=MJ/m^2 (Total solar radiation measured using Pyranometer) Calculated based on the SlrW and scan rate
