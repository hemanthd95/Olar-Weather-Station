# Olar-Weather-Station
This repository shares the information on the metadata of the weather station, and sampling rate, and provides readers with request access to weather station data.<br> 
The variables measured by the weather station and their respective units.<br> 
BattV=Volts (Battery voltage level); Sampled every 5 seconds.<br>
PTemp_C=Deg C; Sampled every 5 seconds.<br>
SlrMJ=MJ/m^2 (Total solar radiation measured using Pyranometer) Calculated based on the SlrW and scan rate.<br>
